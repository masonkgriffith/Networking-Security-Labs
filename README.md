# Networking & Security Lab Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on enterprise networking and security labs designed to simulate real-world infrastructure environments.  

Each lab focuses on secure architecture design, segmentation, routing, firewall policy enforcement, and structured troubleshooting.

The objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical engineering ability beyond certification theory by building, validating, and documenting working infrastructure scenarios.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Each lab is organized in its own directory and includes:

- Architecture overview
- Network addressing design
- Implementation details
- Firewall and routing configurations
- Verification & testing procedures
- Structured troubleshooting analysis
- Screenshots and supporting artifacts
